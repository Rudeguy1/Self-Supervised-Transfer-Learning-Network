# Automated Pancreas Segmentation and Fat Fraction Evaluation Basing a Self-Supervised Transfer Learning Network

---
This code repository provides a network for pancreatic segmentation in abdominal CT scans. The weights of the segmentation network are not randomly initialized but learned from unlabeled abdominal CT images using self-supervised learning. Furthermore, it calculates the infiltration ratio of pancreatic fat.

The segmentation and infiltration of fat in one of our cases. In this case, the fat volume was 89.99ml and the fat infiltration percentage was 9.1%

# **Code Repository Features**

Based on the functionality of the code repository, it can be divided into three parts.

- • Self-supervised learning network
- • Segmentation network
- • Evaluation metrics and calculation of fat infiltration ratio

### Segmentation network：

`infinite_generator_3D.py` ：Used to generate cubic blocks around the pancreas in abdominal CT scans, with a size of 32×64×64.

```
for subset in `seq 0 9`do
python -W ignore infinite_generator_3D.py \
--fold $subset \
--scale 32 \
--data yourdataset \
--save generated_cubes
done
```

`Self supervised training` : Train the data generated by `infinite_generator_3D` using a segmentation network.

"If you are interested in this self-supervised network and want to apply it to your own dataset, you can refer to“[ModelsGenesis/pytorch at master · MrGiovanni/ModelsGenesis (github.com)](https://github.com/MrGiovanni/ModelsGenesis/tree/master/pytorch)”

### Evaluation metrics and calculation of fat infiltration ratio：

`Dice_evaluate.py` : The Dice coefficient, HD95, Jaccard index, Precision, and Sensitivity are used to calculate the agreement between the true values and predicted labels.

`Volume_pancreas.py` : It is used to calculate the volume of the pancreas as well as the fat infiltration ratio, and ultimately generate a pancreatic fat map. 

**Note**: The calculation of fat infiltration here must be based on CT scan images. If only labels from the portal venous phase are available, registration must be performed before the calculation.
